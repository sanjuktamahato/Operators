# Operators
Operators are symbols or functions that perform operations on operands. Common operators include +, −, ×, ÷ for arithmetic, and ∂, ∫, or ∇ in calculus. They can act on numbers, functions, or vectors, and are essential tools in algebra, calculus, and linear algebra for expressing mathematical processes.
